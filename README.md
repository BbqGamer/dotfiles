### ZSH
I am **not** using *oh-my-zsh*, clone theme and plugins manually.
```
mkdir -p ~/.zsh
git clone https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure.git
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
```

Also remember to set shell for your user
`chsh --shell /bin/zsh [USER]`
